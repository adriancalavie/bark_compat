# Bark Compat

This datapack adds compatibility between the **Immersive Weathering** and **Farmer's Delight** mods' bark systems. It also includes compatibility for the **Brewin' and Chewin'** addon for **Farmer's Delight**.

## Features
- Removes the **'birch-to-paper'** recipe from **Immersive Weathering**.
- Makes **Organic Compost** and **Paper** craftable using bark from **Immersive Weathering**.
- Makes **Pale Jane** (from **Brewin' and Chewin'**) craftable using bark from **Immersive Weathering**.

## Limitation
Currentlly, the barks added by Immersive Weathering are hard-coded, so any barks coming from mods not included in [bark.json](./data/bark_compat/tags/items/bark.json) will not work.
